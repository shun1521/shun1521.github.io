      <h2>Detecton of phase trannsicion via Neural Network</h2>
      <p>
        Neural network is the technique of machine learning imitating the human brain.
        This technique enables you to create a machine that hits dogs or cats as output by giving input images of dogs and cats.
        In this paper, we show that we can detect phase transformation without prior knowledge of quantum phase transition of 1D transverse magnetic Ising model.
        The transverse field Ising model is based on quantum annealing.

        In general, since there is no thermal fluctuation in case of cryogenic temperature, spins are observed to be directed upward all the way upward and downward if downward,
         but by adding a transverse magnetic field which causes quantum fluctuation, how many spins we can introduce quantum fluctuation which becomes disagreeable even by observation.
         When the transverse magnetic field is gradually decreased, the spins are steadily aligned from the disaggregated state and the phase transition develops. Such a phase transition caused by quantum fluctuation is called quantum phase transition.

        So let's briefly describe how to detect quantum phase transition using neural network.

        In order to learn neural network, it is necessary to first prepare a large number of data of spin states. It is necessary to prepare a data set whose output is  the strength of quantum fluctuation.

        However, if it is extreme, that is enough.

        The problem is how to construct a data set introducing quantum fluctuation.

         Fortunately, the quantum fluctuation due to the transverse magnetic field which is standardly used in quantum annealing can be simulated by our computer resources.

         We can sample the state of spin in a certain transverse magnetic field using a technique called quantum Monte Carlo method.

         In this study, we first conducted an empirical study using quantum Monte Carlo method.

        Also, T - QARD can use D - Wave Machine 's D - Wave machine. Standard quantum annealing with transverse magnetic field can be performed in this machine.

        We are doing the same simulation by using that data. We will analyze the phase transition occurring on D - Wave and introduce it along with publication of the paper.
    <a href="http://journals.jps.jp/doi/pdf/10.7566/JPSJ.87.033001">This is my paper</a>.  <a href="http://qard.is.tohoku.ac.jp/2018030239/">This is an explanation of T-QARD</a>  </p>
      <h2>Quantum Annealing with non-stoquastic Hamiltonian</h2>
      <p>
         It is possible to accelerate quantum annealing by introducing quantum fluctuation other than the transverse magnetic field.
         An example of that is  anti-ferromagnetic XX interaction.
         It is difficult to directly simulate this quantum fluctuation on a classical computer by quantum Monte Carlo method because a negative sign problem arises.
         However, by using adaptive quantum Monte Carlo method, it is known that quantum fluctuation other than transverse magnetic field can be simulated.
         Using this method, we are analyzing what kind of problems will enable quantum acceleration. </p>
           <h2>Non-negative matrix factorization by utilizing D-Wave</h2>
           <p>It is an applied research applying quantum annealing to machine learning. The matrix V is decomposed into the pattern matrix W and matrix H of whether it comes out or not.
             In this problem, the pattern matrix W is calculated by CPU and the matrix H is binary values obtained by D-Wave.</p>
